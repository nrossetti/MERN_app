# MERN Stack Web App
An exercise in full stack development with node, specifically with the MERN stack and Material UI framework.

## About
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB this "untitled" project is a MVP for a web app which helps connect developers to one another to collaborate with. It is a work in progress as I have lots of ideas for features and concepts to experiment with and will do my best to keep my trello board/repository up to date.

A demo of the application is hosted here:
